### Part 2: History & Evolution (4 slides)

#### Slide 4: Timeline Overview
- 2022: ReAct Paper
- 2023: Native Function Calling
- 2024: Agentic AI Goes Mainstream
- 2025: Production-Ready Agents

#### Slide 5: ReAct - The Beginning
- What is ReAct?
- Thought → Action → Observation
- Why it was revolutionary

#### Slide 6: Why ReAct Fell Short
- No real tool integration
- Context pollution
- Models not trained for agents
- Enter: Native Function Calling

#### Slide 7: The Game Changer - Tool Calling
- OpenAI Function Calling (June 2023)
- First native LLM-tool integration
- What changed: LLMs can now ACT
- Still had issues...
